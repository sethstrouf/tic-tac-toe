Tic Tac Toe Project for The Odin Project

Attempting to:
  - Create objects that act independently
    -Maintainable
    -Extensible
    -Reusable
    -Simpler

What I learned:
  - Classes make organization and testing WAY easier
  - Dealt with 3x3 matrix using .each function

What I need to improve:
  - Still not sure I'm doing OOP correctly - feels too connected still
  - Some methods still feel long - too  many "end" statements
